# Forum Application Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the testing performed on the forum application, which implements a client-server architecture for a discussion forum using both UDP and TCP protocols as specified in the assignment.

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Authentication | PASS | Login, new user creation, and validation all working properly |
| Thread Management | PASS | Creation, listing, reading, and removal functionality verified |
| Message Management | PASS | Posting, editing, and deletion tested successfully |
| File Transfer | PASS | Upload and download via TCP confirmed working |
| Concurrency | PASS | Multiple simultaneous clients operate correctly |
| Reliability | PASS | Packet loss handling mechanisms work as expected |

## Detailed Test Cases

### Authentication
- ✅ Existing user login
- ✅ New user creation
- ✅ Invalid password rejection

### Thread Management
- ✅ Thread creation
- ✅ Thread listing
- ✅ Thread reading
- ✅ Thread removal (by creator)
